# License-Plate-Recognition :police_officer:	
Script that can get the license number from multiple images using OPENCV and EASYOCR.
The script takes the image, applies many different effects to isole the license plate and print it out. 

<p>In the future I might combine hardware with the project where the webcam would take pictures of cars passing down the street with the script printing out the license numbers. </p>
